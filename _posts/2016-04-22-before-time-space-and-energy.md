# Before Time, Space, and Energy

\_This is the story as a time-space creature would view the origin and differentiation of Reality. This is a portrayal of the infinite as having sequential origin, with knowing full well that such is never the case when presenting an interpretative meaning of the infinite... which is a predecessor to mathematics, matter, and spirit. The era of the solitary I AM. An undisclosed instance of Infinity passes if such a time based concept can be ever revealed. The Urantia Book (Synthesis) 

\*Long, long ago, in an all absolute reality back in eternity and without beginning of existence, {||before the dead vaults of space became astir||}; there exist one absolute, there is only the Infinite "I AM." This is the age before time, space, and energy (mass) as we know it. This is reality before all beginnings and after all destinies - the non-beginning, non-ending realities and relationships of the ONE UNCAUSED - the primeval cause of causes. It is the undifferentiated reality of all that could ever be in all of an infinite eternity. The Infinite is used to denote the fullness --- the finality --- implied by the primacy of the First Source and Center.\* The Urantia Book (Synthesis)
